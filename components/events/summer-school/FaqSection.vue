        </template>
        <template #content>
          <p>
            Minimal prerequisites are required for the Qiskit Global Summer School. If you know

              how to multiply two matrices
            </AppLink>
            , and have some programming experience in Python, you are ready for the Summer School.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can

          What are the application requirements for the Summer School?
        </template>
        <template #content>
          <p>
            There is no application or pre-registration for the Qiskit Global Summer School 2022. Registration will be on a first come, first served basis, with scheduled global availability. Once the Summer School registration reaches capacity, unfortunately we will not be able to register any additional students.

          What is the time requirement for the Summer School? Is the scheduled fixed or flexible?
        </template>
        <template #content>
          <p>
            The summer school is made up of a total of 20 lectures, 3 lab sessions &amp; application exercises, in addition to the daily Live Q&amp;A Sessions and final Commencement Celebration. Participation and completion of all labs and lectures are required in order to receive a certificate of completion from the Summer School, with the optional Q&A Sessions and Commencement activities to enhance your Summer School experience. The schedule is not fixed, aside from final lab submission deadlines, and all students can participate on the schedule that works best for them. Students should anticipate a minimum time commitment of 30 hours for the full Summer School, but we recommend planning on 41 hours of participation, with additional time for discussion and collaboration with other students.

        <template #content>
          <p>
            The 2022 Summer School will cover briefly introduce quantum computing before diving into quantum simulations and chemistry, which was not covered in the 2020 or 2021 Summer School, so you should enroll if you are interested!
