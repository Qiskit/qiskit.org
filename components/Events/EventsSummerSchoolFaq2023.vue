        title-text="What are the pre-requisites for enrolling in the Summer School?"
      >
        <p>
          Minimal prerequisites are required for the Qiskit Global Summer
          School. To follow most of the course, you will need to understand the
          basics of linear algebra, including vectors and matrices and how to
          work with them, as well as notions such as linear independence, bases,
          and dimension. You will also need to know how complex numbers work and
          be comfortable with some basic mathematical concepts, such as sets and
          functions. <UiLink v-bind="basicsOfQuantumInformation">Here</UiLink>,
          you can find these foundational concepts explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the most out of the lectures, you may also consider looking
          through the
          <UiLink v-bind="linearAlgebra">linear algebra prerequisites</UiLink>
          section of the Qiskit Textbook and

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="What are the application requirements for the Summer School?"
      >
        <p>
          There is no application or pre-registration for the Qiskit Global
          Summer School 2023. Registration will be on a first come, first served
          basis, with scheduled global availability. Once the Summer School
          registration reaches capacity, unfortunately we will not be able to
          register any additional students.
        </p>
      </bx-accordion-item>

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="What is the time requirement for the Summer School? Is the scheduled
            fixed or flexible?"
      >
        <p>
          The summer school is made up of a total of 12 lectures, 6 lab sessions
          & application exercises, in addition to the daily Live Q&A Sessions
          and the closing panel. Participation and completion of all labs and
          lectures are required in order to receive a certificate of completion
          from the Summer School, with the optional Q&A Sessions and closing
          activities to enhance your Summer School experience. The schedule is
          not fixed, aside from final lab submission deadlines, and all students
          can participate on the schedule that works best for them. Students
          should anticipate a minimum time commitment of 30 hours for the full
          Summer School, but we recommend planning on 41 hours of participation,
          with additional time for discussion and collaboration with other
          students.

        title-text="I was a student at the Qiskit Global Summer School 2021/2022 - should
            I enroll in the 2023 Summer School as well?"
      >
        <p>
          The 2023 Summer School will focus on foundation quantum computing
          concepts with a specific look at making the
          <strong>transition</strong> from
          <strong>theory to implementation</strong>. Although the focus is
          foundational, the labs are still meant to refresh and challenge, so be
          sure to enroll and test your skills if interested.
        </p>

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="Will the lectures and labs be recorded? Or will they only be
            accessible live?"
      >
        <p>
          Lectures, labs, and the live Q&A sessions will all be recorded and
          available for live participation and post viewing.
        </p>

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="Do I need to download anything in order to participate?"
      >
        <p>Nope! Everything can be done in-browser.</p>

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="What is the cost to enroll in the Summer School?"
      >
        <p>There is no cost to participate in the summer school!</p>

      <bx-accordion-item
        title-text="Will I need any supplies or equipment in order to participate?"
      >
        <p>
          You will need a computer with a reliable internet connection and
          either a mobile device or webcam/microphone on your computer to
          communicate with mentors and other students. You will need to be able
          to view seminars and connect virtually. Other than that, you just need
          to bring yourself.
