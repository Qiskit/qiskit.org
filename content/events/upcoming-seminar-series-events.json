    "to": "https://youtu.be/DFc7KjD_bEc",
    "abstract": "While quantum computers are expected to be more powerful than classical computers, the class of tasks that can be performed on a quantum computer in a constant time is limited. However, by allowing the quantum computer to interact with a classical computer over a few rounds, and allowing the classical computer to perform a polynomial-time classical computation, it is possible to achieve tasks that are otherwise impossible to achieve without such interaction.",

    "abstract": "The usual picture of quantum dynamics is that of an isolated system evolving under unitary interactions. Systems in which non-unitary measurements are interspersed among the unitary interactions are now of great interest due to the novel phenomena that occur, including phase transitions of the entanglement properties depending on the measurement rate.",

    "to": "https://www.youtube.com/live/QPQY2dK80ww?feature=share",
    "abstract": "As quantum information processors continue to improve, a better understanding of strongly-interacting dissipative quantum models is required to accurately model such systems. Exact solutions in such instances however are few and far between; adding dissipation to even the simplest closed-system Hamiltonian often means resorting to numerics or employing unjustified approximations.",
