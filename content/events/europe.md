## What is Qiskit Camp?

Qiskit Camps are an immersive experience that consists of training sessions, deep technical talks, and a hackathon alongside the Qiskit core development team. At Qiskit Camp, attendees can collaborate with both quantum researchers and computer scientists to connect with the larger global quantum community.

2019 Qiskit Camp Europe will be hosted near Zürich, Switzerland from 12–15 September. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event.

Attendees that are new to Qiskit, or simply want to increase their proficiency in quantum computing, should attend [Squid](https://qid.ethz.ch/)'s one week summer school from 8–12 September 2019 at ETH Zürich.

## Location

Qiskit Camp Europe will be the first hackathon to take place at [Piz Gloria](https://schilthorn.ch/en/Welcome), a revolving restaurant at the top of Schilthorn Peak in Switzerland. Piz Gloria was originally made famous as Blofeld's clinical facility in the James Bond movie _On Her Majesty's Secret Service_.

Accomodations will be provided in the scenic town of Mürren, a short gondola ride from Piz Gloria.
