This methodology has the potential to speed-up algorithms, such as Monte Carlo analysis. In particular, after demonstrating the effectiveness of the network in the learning task, the technique is applied to price Asian option derivatives, providing the foundation for further research on other path-dependent options.",

    "abstract": "Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are promising candidates for topologically-protected quantum computing hardware, however their large-scale use will likely require quantum error correction. Majorana surface codes (MSCs) have been proposed to achieve this. However, many MSC properties remain unexplored. In this talk I will present a unifying framework for MSC twist defects. Twist defects are objects that are used in other codes for fault-tolerant quantum computation. In the MSC, twist defects can encode twice the amount of topologically protected information as in qubit-based codes or other MSC encoding schemes, owing to their encoding both logical qubits and “logical MZMs.” I will explain this feature and discuss methods for performing universal computation with both logical qubits and logical MZMs and some associated improved overheads. I will also introduce a novel MSC analogue of transversal gates that achieves encoded Clifford gates by braiding the constituent Majoranas. ",
