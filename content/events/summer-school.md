## What is the Qiskit Global Summer School?
Qiskit Global Summer School is a two-week intensive summer school designed to empower the next generation of quantum developers with the knowledge to explore quantum applications on their own. The curriculum covers quantum computing preliminaries before focusing on two key areas: superconducting devices and quantum chemistry applications.

We are incredibly excited to provide this educational opportunity to a broad audience. The lectures of the Qiskit Global Summer School will be thorough, and our team of quantum computing experts will cover all steps of the calculations.

Each day of the Qiskit Global Summer School consists of three hours of lectures followed by an hour of hands-on quantum programming with Qiskit.

## Prerequisites
The prerequisites for the Qiskit Global Summer School are minimal. If you know how to multiply two matrices, and have programming experience in Python, you are ready for the Qiskit Global Summer School.

Attendees who are new to the field of quantum computation and Qiskit are recommended to follow the [Coding With Qiskit video series](http://qisk.it/cwq) and brush up on [Linear Algebra](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/linear_algebra.html) and [Python](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-prerequisites/python-and-jupyter-notebooks.html) by following the Qiskit Textbook before attending the lectures.

## Location

The summer school will be hosted virtually, and recordings will be made available following the lectures. Invitations will be distributed prior to the event. Interested applicants should [apply here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/qiskit-global-summer-school-tickets-108899074062).
