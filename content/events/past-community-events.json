    "to": "https://www.youtube.com/live/vEQ24G8o0KI?feature=share",
    "abstract": "In this work we provide new techniques for a fundamental and ubiquitous task: simulating measurement of a quantum state in the standard basis.  Our algorithms reduce the sampling task to computing poly(n) amplitudes of n-qubit states; unlike previously known techniques they do not require computation of marginal probabilities. ",

We describe a quantum divide-and-conquer framework that, in certain cases, yields quantum speedup through an analogous recurrence relation for the quantum query complexity.",
