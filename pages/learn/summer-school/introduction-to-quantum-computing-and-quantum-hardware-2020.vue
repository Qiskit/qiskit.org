  `This course is an introduction to the world of quantum computing, with
  an exploration of some of the key quantum algorithms and their
  implementations using quantum circuits, as well as the quantum hardware
  that is designed to run these algorithms. The course was first offered
  during the Qiskit Global Summer School in July 2020 as a two-week intensive
  summer school. There are 27 lectures in this course, which cover the
  material in 9 lecture notes and 9 associated labs.`,
