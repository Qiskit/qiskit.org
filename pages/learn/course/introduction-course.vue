  `This short course contains around 3 hours of content and is
  aimed at self-learners from all backgrounds (technical and
  non-technical). The aim of this course is to give a solid
  understanding of the principles behind quantum computing,
  focussing on developing intuition. After this course, you will
  have a fair understanding of quantum computing and Qiskit, as well
  as a short project demonstrating it. You should then be able to
  jump straight into many of the other courses in this
  textbook when they are ready, including traditional algorithms and
  protocols, near term quantum algorithms, and quantum machine
  learning.`,
